# Linear Regression

Statistical model to predict relationship between independent and dependant variables.

```y = ax + b```
- `y` dependant variable (*output*)
- `x` independent variable (*input*)
- `(x(i), y(i))` training example
- a list of *training examples*: **training set**

## Goal
Predict real valued outputs by modeling how observations are **associated** with some features as we change values of theses features

ℹ️ Regression is bout learning about relation between `x` and `y`

# Simple Linear Regression: Model

Θ₁₀

The cost function: evaluating **"the performance of our algorithm/model"**.     
Takes:
- Predicted outputs
- Actual outputs     
Gives:
- How much wrong the model was
